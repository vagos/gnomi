\fBtmp\fR \- temporary files and downloads.

Music is served by \fBmpd\fR with \fBncmpcpp\fR as the client.
If you need integrations with services like YouTube or Spotify, switch to \fBMopidy\fR; it can also expose a web front end so you can control playback from devices on your local network.
.SH SYNCING
Use \fBrsync\fR to sync between machines or directories.
Helper scripts live under \fB~/files/scripts\fR.
.SH CONFIGURATION EDITING
All configuration files should be stored in \fB~/.dotfiles\fR, with appropriate subdirectories for each application and symlinked to their expected locations.
Each one can be freely edited to your liking.
